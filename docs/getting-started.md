## Setting up the Lidar publisher node
### Conguration files
- The configuration files are located in `/src/firos_lidar_brinup/config/`.
- Setup the `config.json`. Here server is the `firos` node and `context_broker` is responsible of transforming ROS messages to the NGSIv2 and interfacing the ROS world with non-ROS world via the OCB.

```json
{
    "environment": "local",
    "local": {
        "server": {
            "port": 10100
        },
        "contextbroker": {
            "address": "localhost",
            "port": 1026
        }
    }
}
```

- The config file `topics.json` defines the topic that needs to be interfaced with OCB. The message type and topic names are defined here. The `publisher` and `subscriber` terminology is at the non-ROS world. The `/scan` and `/tf` are being subscribed by the OCB or in other words these topics are published to the OCB.

```json
{
    "/scan": ["sensor_msgs/LaserScan", "subscriber"],
    "/tf": ["tf2_msgs/TFMessage", "subscriber"]
}
```

- As the name suggests, the `whitelist.json` functions as a whitelist to let FIROS know which messages it should keep track of. Given an environment where already ROS-Applications are running, FIROS will not automatically subscribe to all available topics if no whitelist.json is given. In a small ROS-World with few ROS-Applications, it can be desirable to subscribe to all topics.

```json
{}
```
